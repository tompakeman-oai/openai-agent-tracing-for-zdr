# Traces App
* TO DO
  * Improve the data model - pre join spans and traces to provide trace-level stats like execution time at app load
  * If there are more traces than shown in the list then provide option to fetch more
  * Implement detailed view
  * Fix filter UI (so we don't get overflow)
  * Add routing so button navigation works
